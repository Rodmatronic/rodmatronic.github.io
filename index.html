<title>Awesome website.</title>

  <center><h1>Welcome to my personal website.</h1></center>
  <p>I enjoy working with computers, software and hardware. Yet; no matter what I do, I will still never fully understand why C++ changes it's standards every hour. My preffered programming languages are C, (BA)SH, and Assembly (6502/(80)86, nasm/oldstyle.) I tend to be curious, I like to break open things and figure out how they do what they do. I find UNIX and anything related to be quite interesting.</p>
  <p>I have written some god-awful emulators in C. 8086, and 6502 emulators. I did this simply because I enjoy seeing the backend of how CPUs work, it is endlessly interesting. Speaking of 6502... I have also dabbled in that world a bunch. I personally don't own any 6502 devices, HOWEVER, I have a 6507 cpu that I have fiddled with.</p>
  <p>Anyways, below are my most recent projects, newest first:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><h1>NetOS Linux</h1><p>NetOS is a distribution of Linux I created recently. The goal of NetOS is to be a simple, NetBSD-styled Linux distribution that operates on a 'less is more' philosophy. It uses Busybox INIT for it's init system, Xorg & JWM for it's graphical user interface, and bash for it's main shell. A bootable ISO of NetOS is around 66MB, it has basic networking (as the name would imply) and Xorg built-in. It uses the FBdev graphics system simply because that is all I need it for.</p></li>
